# Part-Time Salaries
A little python tool to calculate salaries with fewer than 40 hours per week

I created this tool while at my last job because our HRIS' UI could not calculate part time salaries and I was often entering them. It's not fancy and I'm just learning python so future me will probably cringe.

# Updates
### May 2023
1. Updated the documentation to include better instructions for Windows and rearranged the layout to increase readability.

### Nov 2020
1. Added a compiled version of ptsalary. Mac OS X compatible. That's it. No need to install Python. Download the zip, unzip and double click ptsalary. View the associated README for more info.

_Once I set up a Windows partition or move my Windows machine I'll create a Windows compatible version._

### Oct 2020
1. Added a fancy header. 
2. Added checks to make sure user input is valid!
3. Streamlined output so it looks a bit nicer. As nice as terminal output can anyway.
4. Created an exit strategy! Now when you type exit, even on a Mac, the program actually exits.

# Features
This tool will take your full time salary and decreased number of hours and do the math for you to calculate what the new part time salary should be. 

For example, say your employee's salary is $68,000.33 per year and they've reduced their hours to 34/week. Sure, you can do the math manually but this is the perfect job for a computer. Please see example of terminal output below.
