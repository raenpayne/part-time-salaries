If you're looking at this and you're in HR but don't have any coding experience you're probably thinking, how do I run this ptsalary.py file? This document will help get you up and running, at least somewhat easily.

## Requirements
 - Python 3.x.x
 - Windows, MacOS, Linux

--

# Install Python. Run the Script.
After you've downloaded the ptsalary.py script you'll need to check whether you have Python installed and if so which version.

To run ptsalary.py you'll need Python 3.x or higher.

## Mac OS X 
If you have a Mac you likely already have an older version of Python installed. However, you'll need to have at least version 3.0 to use Part Time Salary Calculator. 


### Check Current Version of Python
To check your current, default, version of python open up terminal and type:
 
``user$ python --version``

To check which version of python3 is installed type: 

``user$ python3 --version``

As of this writing the current version of python is 3.9.0. 

If you don't have 3.x or higher Part Time Salary Calculator will not run so be sure to update to the latest version.
