# Part Time Salary Calculator:<br>User Guide

#### This user guide will walk you through installing Python and using the ptsalary app.

If you're looking at this and you're in HR but don't have any experience with Python you're probably thinking, how do I run this weird ptsalary.py file? This document will help you get up and running in no time. 

#### Housekeeping
Before you can run ptsalary.py you'll need to do some housekeeping. 

First, you'll notice that the file ends in .py. That indicates it's a python file. Python is a versatile scripting language and you'll need to make sure your computer can understand it. The process is a little different depending on whether you're using OSX or Windows, and steps for each operating system are detailed below. 

#### TL;DR
For both OSX and Windows you'll need to:

1. Download the ptsalary.py file, or the compiled version of you're on OSX
2. Check your version of Python
3. Install Python if you don't already have it or if it's below 3.x
4. Run the script via a Terminal window on OSX or a Command Prompt on Windows. If you're on OSX you also have the option of running a packaged form of the script letting you simply double click an icon.

#### Okay, but how do I use the script?
You can jump to the end of this file if you just want instructions for using the script.

*If you don't have 3.x or higher Part Time Salary Calculator will not run so be sure to update to the latest version.*

To check your current, default, version of Python type the following into Terminal:
 
`user$ python --version`

To check which version of Python3 is installed type: 

`user$ python3 --version`

As of this writing the current version of Python is 3.11.0.
